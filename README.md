# Prostate Cancer miRNA Expression Prediction by Explainable ML algoritms

We used RandomForest, XGBoost, DecisionTree, KNeighbors, SVC, GaussianNB, LogisticRegression ML algoritms to predict miRNA expression. Then we used explainable ML algoritms such as LIME, ANCHOR and SHAP to identify important miRNA genes. We compared our results with standard differential expression analysis.
